## Importing AIML

> AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is an XML-compliant language that’s easy to learn, and makes it possible for you to begin customizing an Alicebot or creating one from scratch within minutes.

AIML stands for Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language. AIML is an XML based markup language meant to create artificial intelligent applications. AIML makes it possible to create human interfaces while keeping the implementation simple to program, easy to understand and highly maintainable. This tutorial will teach you the basics of AIML. All the basic components of AIML with suitable examples have been discussed in this tutorial.

The most important units of AIML are:

- `<aiml>` ― the tag that begins and ends an AIML document
- `<category>` ― the tag that marks a “unit of knowledge” in an Alicebot’s knowledge base
- `<pattern>` ― used to contain a simple pattern that matches what a user may say or type to an ALICE bot
- `<template>` ― contains the response to a user input
